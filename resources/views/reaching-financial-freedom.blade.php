    Reaching Financial Freedom
  </h1> <div><p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5347" src="https://www.armpension.com/wp-content/uploads/thumbnail_NEWSLETTER-REACHING-FINANCIAL-FREEDOM-300x183.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="280"></p><p>School fees are due... Rent needs to be paid, unexpected urgent expenses are required, can I retire now? Do you ever have panic attacks because your income stream cannot pay off your debts or afford your desired lifestyle?</p><p>This is an everyday challenge that we all face because we cannot make life decisions without being anxious and worried about its impact on our finances. Our mindsets on risk and fear of the unknown often times discourages us from maximizing our true potential and attaining “Financial Freedom”.</p><p>Experiencing Financial Freedom is having the “ABILITY” and “CAPACITY” to pursue your dreams, goals and ambitions with no time and money constraints. Achieving this involves deliberate planning and financial discipline.</p><p>In the 21st Century, job security is fast becoming an obscure reality due to the emergence of more advanced technology. It is thereby important that one plans actively and effectively towards attaining financial security and preventing old-age poverty.</p><p>Professionals who are not entrepreneurial driven and are career-oriented can plan toward their desired future goals and ambition by consciously and effectively planning toward retirement. An effective Retirement Plan would entail cultivating and adopting a savings and investment culture, maintaining a mid to long term strategy and making informed investment decisions.</p><p><strong>Additional Voluntary Contributions</strong> are extra funds you can opt to add to your mandatory pension contributions, or simply set aside as retirement savings. These funds would be deducted from your monthly emolument by your employer and remitted into your <strong>ARM Pensions Retirement Savings Account (RSA)</strong>, along with your regular pension contributions.</p><p>AVC differs from other regular savings you may have, as it is deducted from your salary before tax. This is a significant advantage of the AVC, as it means the contributions are tax-free and lower your overall tax liability.</p><p>For more information on the AVC contact your dedicated Relationship Manager or call us and email us on +234-01-2715005, hvc@armpension.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-small bg-claret text-white mt-3"><i class="fa fa-arrow-alt-circle-left px-3"></i> Back to Posts</button></div></div></div></div></div>
