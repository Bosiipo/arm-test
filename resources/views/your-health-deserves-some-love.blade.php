When your health fails, everything else becomes irrelevant, hence the need to prioritize your health with these tips.</p><p><strong>Less stress</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5513" src="https://www.armpension.com/wp-content/uploads/EYHDSL-2-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170"></p><p>Did you know that persistent emotional stress can weaken your immune system and cause high blood pressure, fatigue, depression, anxiety and sometimes heart disease? Now you see why you must limit both physical and emotional stress in your life.</p><p><strong>Healthier food options</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5514" src="https://www.armpension.com/wp-content/uploads/EYHDSL-3-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170"></p><p>You wouldn’t put bad oil in your car engine for fear of it getting damaged right? Then why would you take meals and snacks you know are processed and could potentially damage your inner organs? Choose foods and snacks that are close to natural as possible, and simply find ways to eliminate fizzy drinks which bring no nutritional value whatsoever to your body system.</p><p><strong>More activity</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5515" src="https://www.armpension.com/wp-content/uploads/EYHDSL-4-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170"></p><p>Our bodies are made to move and leading a sedentary lifestyle is the quickest way to weaken the muscles that should carry the body through basic day-to-day functions. Find ways to stay more active even if you work a 9-5 desk job. Take the stairs, walk around when taking a call, visit the gym when you can… just aim to stay active.</p><p><strong>Regular check-up</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5516" src="https://www.armpension.com/wp-content/uploads/EYHDSL-5-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170"></p><p>The human body is an intricate machine that only experts trained in handling them can decipher when something is wrong. Don’t depend on over the counter medications whenever you have a headache. Part of loving your health is allowing a doctor to do a total body check-up at least every 4 months to ensure you are in tip-top shape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With your health loved up, you are in a better state to love to the ones you care about in the way they deserve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Did you know that with an Additional Voluntary Contribution, you can grow your retirement savings enough to live a comfortable life upon retirement? <a href="http://www.armpension.com/avc">Click to learn about the AVC</a></em></p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-small bg-claret text-white mt-3"><i class="fa fa-arrow-alt-circle-left px-3"></i> Back to Posts</button></div></div></div></div></div>
