If anything, it’s the perfect time to ensure that productivity is at an all-time high and then keep that momentum up for the rest of the year.</p><p>These tips will help you achieve more and keep you on your boss's radar&nbsp; – because we all know that every boss loves super-efficient subordinates who get the job done well.</p><p>Take a look at the tips:</p><p><strong>No Multitasking</strong></p><p>Research shows that when you attempt doing several things at once, it hinders productivity costing up to 40% of your time. The reason for this is that your focus and concentration is constantly stalled because you have to switch between tasks. This means you have to face a task and finish before moving on to another.</p><p><strong>Turn off notifications</strong></p><p>When you turn off notifications on your phone during work hours, it limits the urge to constantly check your phone – which is a distraction from your current task or even a chain of productive thoughts. If you have access to social media on your work computer, a good move would be to log out of your accounts.</p><p><strong>Eat the biggest frog first</strong></p><p>Mark Twain says “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.”</p><p>This quote simply means: Attack your biggest most urgent tasks first thing and take the pressure off, in order to settle in and stay motivated to enjoy finishing the smaller ones.</p><p><strong>Reduce ‘meeting’ times</strong></p><p>You probably know of people who meet for long stretches of time several times during the week to discuss the most mundane things – some of which can be resolved by sending an email. Don’t be like these people. Use your time wisely and only attend meetings when it’s absolutely necessary.</p><p><strong>Take breaks</strong></p><p>Just like engines breakdown with incessant use, your brain and body can pack up too if you don’t give them a break. Regular breaks are necessary to break the norm of being sedentary which places one at a higher risk for obesity and other cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Aside from that, research shows that even a 30-second micro-break can boost your productivity levels by up to 30%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final words:</strong> Now that your productivity is on its way to acceleration, you can begin eyeing a pay raise or a juicier position with better pay. This essentially means that you can meet more needs, invest more and grow your pension pot with <a href="http://www.armpension.com/avc">Additional Voluntary Contributions</a>.
